Just Dance 4 also offers some variety in its song selection, with tracks from different decades and genres. You can groove to classics like Elvis Presley's \"Jailhouse Rock\" or The Buggles' \"Video Killed the Radio Star\", or rock out to Queen's \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" or The Clash's \"Rock the Casbah\". There are also some international hits, such as Bollywood's \"Beware of the Boys\" by Panjabi MC, or K-pop's \"Gangnam Style\" by PSY (available as downloadable content). Whether you prefer pop, rock, disco, or hip-hop, there is something for everyone in Just Dance 4.
 
If you want to take a break from the party mode, you can try the Sweat mode, which is designed to help you burn some calories while dancing. You can choose from predefined playlists that last from 10 to 45 minutes, or create your own custom playlist with your favorite songs. The game tracks how many calories you burn and how long you dance, and gives you feedback on your progress. You can also set a daily or weekly goal and see how close you are to achieving it. Sweat mode is a fun way to exercise and stay fit, but don't expect it to be very accurate or reliable. The game doesn't take into account your weight, height, age, or other factors that affect your calorie expenditure, and it only measures the movement of your right hand holding the Wii Remote. Still, it's better than sitting on the couch doing nothing.
 
Just Dance 4 is not a game that tries to reinvent itself or offer anything new or innovative. It sticks to its proven formula of catchy songs, wacky dances, and simple controls that anyone can pick up and play. It's a game that knows its audience and delivers what they want: a fun, energetic, and hilarious party game that can make anyone feel like a star on the dance floor. Sure, Just Dance 4 doesn't bring much in the way of new features to the party, but if all you want is to have one hell of a fun time with your friends, there really is no party like a Just Dance party.
